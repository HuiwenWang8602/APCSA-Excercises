# APCSA-Excercises
Some easy java exercises from amhs 2019 AP CSA class. Some may be just code fragments and/or incomplete.

Code was done in Java with [BlueJ](https://bluej.org/) for the most part.

Note that since BlueJ automatically completes README files, those are in each respective folder, but are all rather empty. None of the excercises are really that complex, so the name/a glance at the source code should suffice.

Archived because why not, nice way to keep track of what I did/learned in that class (older seperate excercises are also privated).
